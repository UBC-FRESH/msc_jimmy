## ðŸŒ² Background 

This is the preparation repository for the forest estate modeling. Existing LCA biogenic carbon studies only used the stand-level simulation for timber supply simulation. However, the stand-level simulation faced the start-point problem when you have to consider the initial age in the existing forest. 

The point of origin for the simulationâ€”whether from harvesting or plantingâ€”can significantly influence emission results. For instance:
- Starting the simulation from harvesting makes the model start from immediate emissions.
- Starting from planting centers on carbon sequestration. 

Consequently, simulations that begin with planting suggest a positive climate impact for the products, while those starting from harvesting indicate the opposite.

To address this, we adopted the forest landscape-level simulation model - the forest estate model. This optimization model balances the forest timber supply and forest growing stock retention. In simple terms, if we harvest all the volume growing during a coming year, we achieve timber supply while the forest tree carbon pool remains intact. The model not only finds the growing volume but also offers the flexibility to explore other harvest scenarios. The forest estate model aggregates all the stand-level simulations in the area and considers them holistically. 

For the forest estate model, we need the forest's initial inventory and the stand-level growth and yield curve. We analyzed the forest inventory with geopandas to determine similar stands in the forest and later aggregate them. The analyzed representative stands information will be used to find the yield curve from the government forest growth model. This will then be the input for the forest estate model.
